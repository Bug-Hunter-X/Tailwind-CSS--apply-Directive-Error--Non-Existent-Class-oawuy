This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist.  This can happen due to typos, outdated class names after refactoring, or using classes from a plugin that isn't correctly installed or configured.  The error isn't always immediately obvious; sometimes Tailwind will just silently ignore the `@apply` directive, leading to unexpected styling issues.
